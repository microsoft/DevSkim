# Do Not Store Sensitive Data in NSUserDefaults

## Summary

* Code was found that stores a secret such as a password or key in `NSUserDefaults`.
* Consider another secret storage mechanism such as the Keychain API.

## Details

The keys and values saved in `NSUserDefaults` are stored in an unencrypted file that can be easily viewed.
Therefore, `NSUserDefaults` is not a secure way to store secrets.
Secrets should be stored using a different mechanism such as the Keychain API.

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this issue depends on the sensitivity of the secret and the impact of any attack leveraging that secret.
