# Do Not Store Tokens or Keys in Source Code

## Summary

* A token or key was found in source code.
* Secrets should be moved to location where they can be securely managed such as a key vault.

## Details

Secrets are commonly used for authentication or cryptography (e.g., signing or encryption of data.)
Secrets may include passwords, API keys, certificates, or encryption keys.
The security of authentication and cryptography relies on keeping these secrets out of the hands of attackers.

Storing secrets in source code is not secure.
There have been many scenarios where an attacker has gotten access to source code, leading to a security breach
leveraging hardcoded secrets.

Storing secrets in source code also makes it more difficult to manage the lifecycle of a secret.
Secrets should be periodically changed (e.g., API keys rotated.)
Modifying source code, building, and deploying an application is typically more difficult than updating values in
a secure secret management technology (e.g., a key vault.)

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this issue depends on the sensitivity of the data or operations protected by the secret.
