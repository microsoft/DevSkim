# Do Not Seed Randomness Based on System Time or a Static Value

## Summary

* Passing a predictable value to `srand` is very insecure and should be avoided.
* If possible, replace usage of `srand` with `rand_s`. Otherwise, use an unpredictable seed (such as reading from `/dev/random` on Linux.)

## Details

Random number generation is an important part of several security scenarios such as cryptography or generation of unique IDs.
Using a weak random number generator (RNG) or predictable seed for RNG undermines security and may introduce a vulnerability.

## Solution

* Use `BCryptGenRandom` or `rand_s` on Windows
* Linux
  * C++ 11 or newer, use `std::mt19937 eng` in combination  with `std::random_device` to generate a seed.
  * Read from `/dev/random` for a seed.

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this finding is increased if the random number is used in a security context (e.g., creation of an initialization vector.)
