# Do not use weak/non-cryptographic random number generators

## Summary

* Do not use weak random number generators in security-sensitive contexts.
* Security functions should use cryptographically secure random number generators.

## Details

Computers are generally unable to produce truly random numbers.
Random number generation (RNG) techniques are divided into two types: statistical and cryptographic.
Statistical RNG produce predictable results that are not suitable when security depends on unpredictable random values.
Cryptographic RNG produces output that is highly improbably for an attacker to predict or guess.
Therefore, cryptographic RNG should be used in security-sensitive contexts.

## Severity Considerations

There have been multiple instances where weak RNG wa used in the implementation of SSL and elliptic curve digital signature algorithms,
which lead to attackers being able to recover private keys.
Such attacks may compromise the security of the entire system or communication scheme.

## Solution

Replace usages of weak random number generation with a cryptographically secure alternative.

### .NET

* Replace usages of the insecure `System.Random` with the cryptographically secure `RandomNumberGenerator.Create`
