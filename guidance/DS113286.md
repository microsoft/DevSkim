# Do Not Include User Input Directly in Format Strings

## Summary

* Do not create NSString objects using a user-provided format string, as this could lead to a vulnerability.
* Either remove creation of the NSString object entirely or remove the user-provided format string from the NSString object.

## Details

If an attacker is able to control a format string then the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary code,
read data in memory, or crash the application. This is known as an uncontrolled format string vulnerability.
Format string vulnerabilities commonly occur when a developer intends to output user-controlled data (to a screen, buffer, or file)
but mistakenly outputs a buffer directly or treats user data as a format string.

## Solution

Either remove creation of the NSString object entirely or remove the user-provided format string from the NSString object.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a format string vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
