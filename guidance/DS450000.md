# .NET Framework Version

## Summary

* New applications should target a supported version of .NET (formerly .NET Core) if possible.
* .NET Framework applications should target at least .NET Framework 4.7.2.

## Details

Older versions of .NET framework have reached end-of-life state and will no longer receive security patches. .NET Framework applications should target supported versions.

Furthermore, .NET Framework 4.7.2 offers a large number of cryptographic enhancements necessary to prevent against modern cryptographic attacks. Therefore, .NET Framework applications should target at least version 4.7.2. Note that transport layer security (TLS) security guidance advises developers to target .NET Framework 4.8 or later for TLS 1.3 support.

If possible, new applications should target a supported version of .NET (formerly .NET Core) because the .NET Framework is no longer under active development and is only receiving security patches.
