# Do not execute user-provided JavaScript

## Summary

* Code that may execute user-provided JavaScript was found.
* If possible, do not use user-provided data in strings to be executed as JavaScript.
* If user-provided strings must be included then they should be properly sanitized and encoded.

## Details

The application uses `stringByEvaluatingJavaScriptFromString`, `evaluateJavaScript`, or `callAsyncJavaScript`
to dynamically evaluate strings as JavaScript. This may lead to a cross-site scripting vulnerability if
user supplied-data that has not been properly sanitized is executed as JavaScript.

## Solution

If possible, do not use user-provided data in strings to be executed as JavaScript.
If user-provided strings must be included then they should be properly sanitized and encoded.

## Severity Considerations

An XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
The attacker's code may be able to access sensitive information retained by the victim's browser.
XSS attacks can also rewrite page contents, redirect the victim's browser, and/or deliver malware to the victim's machine.
