# All Controllers Should Derive From Controller

## Summary

* A Controller class was found that does not derive from `System.Web.Mvc.Controller` or `System.Web.Http.ApiController`
* All Controllers Should Derive from the appropriate MVC or Web API Controller class.

## Details

The MVC and Web API Controller base classes provide a number of security benefits out of the box.
Controllers that derive from these classes can take advantage of these features such as:

* Use of `[Authorize]` and related attributes to enforce access control
* Use of `[ValidateAntiForgeryToken]` attribute to protect against cross-site request forgery (CSRF).

A number of MVC and Web API features such as default routing also rely on custom Controllers deriving from the base Controller classes.
