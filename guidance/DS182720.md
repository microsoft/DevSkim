# A Weak Cipher Mode of Operation Was Used

## Summary

* A potentially weak cipher mode of operation was used.
* Use CBC, CTR, or GCM mode of operation if possible.

## Details

Block cipher algorithms (such as AES) operate on **blocks**, which are fixed-length set of bits.
The mode of operation describes how a block cipher is to be applied on data larger than a single block
(e.g., by taking data from processing of previous blocks and using it in processing of future blocks.)
Different modes of operation provide different security guarantees of confidentiality and integrity of the data.
Some modes of operations (such as ECB) do not provide sufficient security guarantees and are subject to different
cryptographic attacks such as brute force or replay attacks.

Block cipher algorithms should use CBC, CTR, or GCM mode of operation if possible.

## Severity Considerations

Any use of weak modes of operation, especially ECB, should be very carefully reviewed by a security expert or cryptographer to understand the risks involved.
