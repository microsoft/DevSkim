# Initializing Security Context

## Summary

The `InitializeSecurityContext` function was detected; its usage and surrounding code should be reviewed for security issues.

## Details

The `InitializeSecurityContext` function is used to build a security context between the client application and a remote peer.
A security context contains security data relevant to the connection (such as user identifiers or session key.)

Proper initialization, usage, and cleanup of security contexts can be a complex process and mistakes can lead to security issues.
See the [InitializeSecurityContext documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/secauthn/initializesecuritycontext--general#remarks)
for more guidance. In particular, use of cryptography in this area should be carefully reviewed for potential problems.

## Severity Considerations

Code including usage of the `InitializeSecurityContext` function should be very carefully reviewed
by a security expert or cryptographer to identify security issues and understand the risks involved.
