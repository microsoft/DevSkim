# Problematic C Function Detected (memcpy)

## Summary

* Use of the `memcpy` function can lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
* Resolve this issue by using secure versions such as `memcpy_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Details

There are a number of conditions in which `memcpy` can introduce a vulnerability (mismatched buffer sizes, null pointers, etc.). More secure alternatives perform additional validation of the source and destination buffer.

## Solution

Usages of `memcpy` should be replaced with more secure versions such as `memcpy_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a buffer overrun vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
