# Review setTimeout for untrusted data

## Summary

* Avoid use of untrusted data within `setTimeout`

## Description

Several DOM functions such as `setTimeout` and `eval` will execute a string parameter as code. If untrusted data (data from HTTP requests, user submitted files, etc.) is included in a `setTimeout` call it can allow an attacker to inject and execute their own code.

## Recommendation

Edit the `setTimeout` call so that untrusted data is NOT included. If untrusted data is absolutely necessary a great deal of care should be taken to ensure it is properly escaped so that it cannot be executed. This is not as simple as just escaping quotes.
