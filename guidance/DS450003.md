## Debug build is enabled in System.Web

### Summary

Having a debug build can leak sensitive information from the application to users.

### Details

Debug mode causes your application to provide additional technical information that is intended for a debugger to consume which, while handy for debugging purposes, is inefficient and can disclose sensitive information to the user.
