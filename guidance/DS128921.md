# Hardcoded initialization vector size

## Summary

* An initialization vector was created to a static size, rather than determining it based on the encryption algorithm used.
* Use `mcrypt_get_iv_size` to get the correct IV size based on the cipher and mode.

## Severity Considerations

Using an initialization vector that is shorter than the expected size may or re-use of initialization vectors
may reveal information about the data being encrypted, particularly when using streaming cipher modes like
Output Feedback (OFB) or Counter (CTR).
