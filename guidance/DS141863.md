# Banned C function detected (strcat)

## Summary

* Use of the `strcat` function to concatenate strings can lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
* Use secure versions such as `strcat_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Details

The `strcat` function does not check for sufficient space in the destination buffer.
If the combination of strings is larger than the destination buffer, the `strcat` will overflow the destination buffer.
This is a potential cause of a buffer overrun vulnerability.

## Solution

Use secure versions such as `strcat_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a buffer overrun vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
