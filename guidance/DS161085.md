# Problematic C function detected (malloc)

## Summary

* Use of the `malloc` function is error-prone and can lead to exploitable conditions.
* If possible, replace usages of `malloc` with the `new` operator.

## Details

Secure usage of `malloc` is difficult and error-prone.
Unsafe usage of `malloc` can lead to heap corruption, heap overflow, and buffer overflow conditions.
If the value provided to `malloc` is the result of unsafe integer math, it can also result in an exploitable condition.

The `malloc` function allocates memory space.
Each successful `malloc` call requires a corresponding `free` call to free the allocated memory.
Using memory after it has been can lead to a use-after-free vulnerability.

## Solution

Developers should use the `new` operator when possible rather than the problematic `malloc` function.
The `new` operator is type safe and automatically calls the type's constructor and destructor, which
should handle any necessary memory allocation and deletion.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, unsafe `malloc` usage can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
