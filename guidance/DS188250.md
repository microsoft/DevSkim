# Missing initialization vector

## Summary

* The `mcrypt_encrypt` function was used without an initialization vector.
* Use secure random number generation to create an initialization vector.

## Details

The security of many symmetric encryption cipher modes is weakened when an initialization vector is not used.
That is, information about the plaintext data may be leaked to an attacker when an initialization vector is not used.

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this issue corresponds to the sensitivity of the data being encrypted by the application.
