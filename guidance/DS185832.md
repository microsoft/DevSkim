# Banned C function detected (strcpy)

## Summary

* Use of the `strcpy` function to copy a string can lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
* Use secure versions such as `strcpy_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Details

The `strcpy` function does not check for sufficient space in the destination buffer.
This is a potential cause of a buffer overrun vulnerability.
A buffer overflow will occur if the source is larger than the destination.

## Solution

Use secure versions such as `strcpy_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a buffer overrun vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
