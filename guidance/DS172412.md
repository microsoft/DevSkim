# Unsafe Keyword

The `unsafe` keyword denotes an unsafe context, which is required for any operation involving pointers. Unsafe code in is not necessarily dangerous; it is just code whose safety cannot be verified by the CLR.

Using unsafe code introduces security and stability risks. Special attention should be paid to any user-controlled data that is used within unsafe code.
