# An Outdated or Banned SSL/TLS Protocol is Used

## Summary

* An outdated and insecure SSL/TLS protocol is used.
* Use TLSv1.3 if possible or TLSv1.2 if 1.3 cannot be used.
* It is generally better to rely on operating system configuration rather than hardcoding a specific TLS version.

## Details

There are multiple versions of the SSL/TLS protocol. As of March
2020, their security posture is generally agreed to be:

* SSLv2 - Broken, do not use under any circumstances.
* SSLv3 - Broken, do not use under any circumstances.
* TLSv1 - Weak, strongly consider disabling unless absolutely required.
* TLSv1.1 - Weak, strongly consider disabling unless absolutely required.
* TLSv1.2 - Strong, acceptable for use for the foreseeable future.
* TLSv1.3 - Strong, acceptable for use for the foreseeable future.

Generally speaking, you should target TLS 1.2 and TLS 1.3 on all clients
and servers.

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this finding should be increased if the underlying security
context is highly sensitive or if the network has low trust.
