# Use of Restricted Functions

## Summary

* A restricted PowerShell function was detected.
* Remove or replace usage of the restricted function if possible.

## Details

Use of several different PowerShell functions open up applications to classes of vulnerabilities that would otherwise not normally occur.
We refer to these functions as restricted functions.
For example, `System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal` functions could be used to allocate memory in a way that an attacker could use to corrupt memory and potentially execute code.

## Solution

Replace usage of the restricted function with a conventional function if possible (for example, replace `Invoke-Command` or `Invoke-Expression` with `Start-Process`).

## Severity Considerations

Usage of restricted PowerShell functions should be very carefully reviewed
by a security expert to identify security issues and understand the risks involved.

## Restricted Function List

* `GetDelegateForFunctionPointer`
* `System.Runtime.InteropServices.Marshal`
* `WriteByte`
* `Microsoft.Win32.UnsafeNativeMethods`
* `PtrToStructure`
* `StructureToPtr`
* `NtCreateThreadEx`
* `CreateRemoteThread`
* `Invoke-Command`
* `Invoke-Expression`
* `VirtualProtect`
