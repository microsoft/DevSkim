# Banned C function detected (strncpy)

## Summary

* Use of the `strncpy` function to copy strings can lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
* Resolve this issue by using secure versions such as `strncpy_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Details

The `strncpy` function does NOT check for sufficient space in the destination buffer which may lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
The `strncpy` function is dangerous, as if the source contains 'n' or more characters, it will not null terminate the destination.

## Solution

Use secure versions such as `strncpy_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a buffer overrun vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
