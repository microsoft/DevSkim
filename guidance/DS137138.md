# Insecure Transport (HTTP)

## Summary

* An HTTP-based URL without TLS was detected, potentially exposing confidential information to man-in-the-middle attacks.
* If possible, change this to an HTTPS-based URL to enforce transport-layer encryption.

## Details

One important aspect of application security involves protecting data as it is transferred between clients and servers. In the
case of a web-application, this means between your web-browser and a web-server. One of the most important mechanisms for
protecting this data is enabling TLS (previously known as SSL). When configured correctly, it provides a high level of assurance
that any party with access to network traffic will not be able to view or modify data as it passes.

Many web-servers already support TLS, as do many CDNs.

## Severity Considerations

If the application is handling sensitive data, this finding should generally be rated as 'critical'.

If this finding was applied to text that doesn't actually imply a network connection (e.g. within an XML schema or as an opaque
identifier), then this finding can be ignored.
