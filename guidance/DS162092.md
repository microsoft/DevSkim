# Do not leave debug code in production

## Summary

* Code referencing "localhost" or "127.0.0.1" was found which may indicate debug code.

## Details

Accessing localhost could indicate debug code, or could hinder scaling.
Debug code is a common source of vulnerabilities or security risks as debug code
often lacks security controls enforced elsewhere in the application.

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this issue depends on the functionality exposed by debugging capabilities.
