# Do Not Copy a FILE object (CERT FIO38-C)

## Summary

* Code was found that may create a by-value copy of a `FILE` object.
* Use a pointer to the `FILE` object rather than creating a copy.

## Details

The CERT Secure Coding Standard recommends that FILE objects not be copied.
According to the C standard,
> The address of the FILE object used to control a stream may be significant; a copy of a FILE object need not serve in place of the original.

## Severity Considerations

Using a copy of a FILE object in place of the original may result in an application crash.
