# Banned C function detected (gets)

## Summary

* Use of the `gets` function to read into a buffer can lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
* Resolve this issue by using secure versions such as `gets_s` or `fgets` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Details

The `gets` function will read in as many bytes as are provided, regardless of the size of buffer receiving the bytes.
This allows for conditions that cause a buffer overflow in the destination buffer.

There is no way to limit the number of characters read by the `gets` function.
Untrusted input can easily cause buffer overruns.

## Solution

Usages of `gets` should be replaced with more secure versions such as `gets_s` or `fgets` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a buffer overrun vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
