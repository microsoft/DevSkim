# ProtectedData used without additional entropy

## Summary

The DPAPI `ProtectedData.Protect` method should be used with additional entropy to reduce the risk of other applications accessing the data.

## Details

The `ProtectedData.Protect` method's `optionalEntropy` parameter is an "optional additional byte array used to increase the complexity of the encryption."
Depending on the value of the `scope` parameter, user data encrypted without entropy can be accessed:

* **DataProtectionScope.CurrentUser**: by other threads or applications running under the current user.
* **DataProtectionScope.LocalMachine**: by any process running on the computer.

The `optionalEntropy` parameter should be set to a non-null value unique to your application.

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this finding should be increased if the underlying security
context is highly sensitive or if the environment hosting the application has low trust.
