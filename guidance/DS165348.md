# Do not attempt to access device UDID

## Summary

* Code that references `uniqueIdentifier` was found.
* Replace usage of `uniqueIdentifier` with `identifierForVendor` or if your application has a service component,
use the `DeviceCheck` API.

## Details

Access to the device `UDID` (via [[UIDevice currentDevice] uniqueIdentifier]) is deprecated as of iOS 5 and removed as of iOS7.

## Solution

Replace usage of `uniqueIdentifier` with `identifierForVendor`.
Note that `identifierForVendor` may change if the user uninstalls all applications from a vendor and then re-installs an application from that vendor.
If your application has a service component, consider using the `DeviceCheck` API.

## Severity Considerations

Applications relying on `uniqueIdentifier` can no longer target current, supported iOS versions and must be updated.
