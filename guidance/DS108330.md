# Banned C function detected (strncat)

## Summary

* Use of the `strncat` function to concatenate strings can lead to a buffer overrun vulnerability.
* Resolve this issue by using secure versions such as `strncat_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Details

The `strncat` function does not check for sufficient space in the destination string which is a potential cause of buffer overruns.
The `strncat` function appends characters to a string followed by the null terminator at character 'n + 1', rather than at the nth character.
This behavior frequently leads to the null terminator being added in the memory adjacent to the destination buffer, rather than in the destination buffer.

## Solution

Use secure versions such as `strncat_s` to help prevent buffer overruns.

## Severity Considerations

In the worst case, a buffer overrun vulnerability can provide an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary code leading to complete system compromise.
