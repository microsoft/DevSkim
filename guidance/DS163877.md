# Do not echo unencoded GET/POST/COOKIE values

## Description

When using $_GET/POST/COOKIE values via echo, failure to  encode the values will lead to Cross Site Scripting (XSS), where a malicious party can inject script into the webpage.

## Solution

HTML Entity Encode (for content going into HTML) or URL Encode (for content going into JavaScript variables) the data.

## Severity Considerations

An XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser.
The attacker's code may be able to access sensitive information retained by the victim's browser.
XSS attacks can also rewrite page contents, redirect the victim's browser, and/or deliver malware to the victim's machine.
