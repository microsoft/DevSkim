# Do Not Use the mcrypt Module, use OpenSSL

## Summary

* Usage of a function from the end-of-life `mcrypt` module was found.
* Replace usages of `mcrypt` with `OpenSSL`.

## Details

PHP's `mcrypt` module is end-of-life, no longer supported, and should not be considered secure.
The functions of the `mcrypt` module were deprecated in PHP 7.1.0 and removed in PHP 7.2.0 in 2017.
The PHP `mcrypt` module is based on `libmcrypt`, which has been abandoned since 2007.
End-of-life libraries may contain vulnerabilities that will not be fixed and developers are
encouraged to moved to a library that is actively maintained.

## Solution

Replace usages of `mcrypt` with `OpenSSL`.

## Severity Considerations

The severity of this issue corresponds to the sensitivity of the data being encrypted by the application.
