# Do not use the 3DES symmetric block cipher

## Summary

* The 3DES cipher was found which does not provide sufficient security.
* Replace usage of 3DES with AES if possible.

## Details

The [Data Encryption Standard](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triple_DES), or 3DES, is a symmetric block cipher created in the 1970s.
TripleDES is broken due to its inadequate key size and [CVE-2016-2183](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2016-2183) and should not be used anywhere.

## Severity Considerations

Any use of the 3DES algorithm should be very carefully reviewed by a security expert or cryptographer to understand the risks involved.

## Solution

### .NET

Use the following method: `System.Security.Cryptography.Aes.Create()`
