# Do Not Take the Hash of Low-Entropy Content

## Summary

* Taking a hash of a time value is suspicious, as there is insufficient entropy to protect against brute-force attacks.
* Instead, use a high quality source of entropy such as a cryptographic random number generator.

## Details

In cryptography, entropy is the quality of unpredictable randomness.
The security provided by hashing algorithms relies on attackers inability to find a hash collision (typically via brute force attacks.)
Using a hash algorithm with low quality sources of entropy, such as time, provide insufficient protection against brute-force attacks.

## Solution

Use a high quality source of entropy such as a cryptographic random number generator.

## Severity Considerations

Use of hashing algorithms with an appropriate source entropy should be very carefully reviewed by a security expert or cryptographer to understand the risks involved.
