DevSkim is a framework of IDE extensions and language analyzers that provide inline security analysis 
in the dev environment as the developer writes code. It has a flexible rule model that supports multiple programming
languages. The goal is to notify the developer as they are introducing a security
vulnerability in order to fix the issue at the point of introduction, and to help build awareness
for the developer.
