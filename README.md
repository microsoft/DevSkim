DevSkim is a framework of IDE extensions and language analyzers that provide inline security analysis 
in the dev environment as the developer writes code. It has a flexible rule model that supports multiple programming
languages. The goal is to notify the developer as they are introducing a security
vulnerability in order to fix the issue at the point of introduction, and to help build awareness
for the developer.

### Command Line Interface
#### .NET Core Global Tool (Recommended)

If you already have the .NET SDK installed, you can install the DevSkim CLI as a dotnet global tool by running the following from a command line:

`dotnet tool install --global Microsoft.CST.DevSkim.CLI`

This will add DevSkim to your PATH. You can then invoke `devskim` from a command line.

#### .NET Core Runtime Dependent App

First download and install the [Latest .NET runtime](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/).
Then download the DevSkim netcoreapp archive from the [releases page](https://github.com/microsoft/DevSkim/releases). Extract the archive, navigate to the DevSkim folder from a command line, and invoke `dotnet devskim.dll`.
